 ### Notice: The F-droid Fork of getChromium is Dangerously Out-of-Date
   The F-droid fork of getChromium is built using a library that was deprecated over 2 years ago.  
   Until the F-droid fork is updated to the official volley library, I cannot recommend it or link to it.  
   More information on the deprecated library https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley
