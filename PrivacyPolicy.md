# getChromium's Commitment to Your Privacy

getChromium (“getChromium,” “we,” or “us”) understands that privacy is tremendously important to getChromium users.
getChromium was created for the sole purpose of providing a fully transparent,   
vettable 100% free and open source GPLv3 app that installs Chromium for Android.  
Period.  
getChromium does not collect data of any kind from any user, ever.  
getChromium does not report data to anyone, ever.  


getChromium does nothing unless you tell it to and then getChromium sits dormant until you use it next.  
getChromium is a minimalist Android app designed to conserve battery as well as bandwith.  

getChromium is designed to comply with the Unix philosophy:  
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.  
getChromium installs Chromium for Android, and getChromium does this well.  

getChromium only downloads the official builds of Chromium for Android from the official 
repository of the Chromium team.

The two downloads getChromium is capable of making are the following:  

getChromium uses data to determine which version of Chromium is the newest:
https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Android/LAST_CHANGE

getChromium uses data to securely download the newest Chromium APK:
https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/android/LAST_CHANGE/chrome-android.zip
